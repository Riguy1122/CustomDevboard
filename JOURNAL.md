## 10/6/2025 8 PM - Started a Kicad project!  

This is the beginning! I'm brand new to Kicad and even this type of project in general, so I've been playing around in the schematic view to get a feel for it. I've done research on the different tools and how to add components from the library to understand what I'm doing.![Screenshot from 2025-10-06 13-14-08.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6ODA2LCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--f693c70c080eadf7dccdd5718fc6fcfb0524a498/Screenshot%20from%202025-10-06%2013-14-08.png)
  

## 10/6/2025 11 PM - Got to work on the main project now!  

I've now began reading the community guide on how to build this RP2040 devboard, and started with the basics. For now I'm going to follow the guide all they way through, and add to the final product to make it my own.

I Got the very basics put out right now in the schematics editor. We've got the main RP2040 placed in the center, and the decoupling capacitors for both the 3.3v line and 1.1v line.

Next step is to work on USB-c.<img width="1920" height="1080" alt="Screenshot from 2025-10-06 16-42-00" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0f49f66c-682e-4c03-9abd-dbe9daec8446" />

  

## 10/7/2025 - USB-C & Crystal Oscillator  

I've now added the USB-c receptacle, as well as the LDO to lower the voltage from 5V to 3.3V, to not fry the board! After research I went with the MCP1700x-330xxMB over the MCP1700x-330xxTT simply because the MCP1700x-330xxMB can handle a higher thermal load then the xxTT, whether that will be significant enough I'm not sure, but better safe then sorry!

Now moving on to the crystal oscillator, I've also implemented a 12MHz crystal as the guide says, and the next thing to move onto is flash storage.![Screenshot from 2025-10-06 19-04-59.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6ODMzLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--e4de4477fed2540c7d29d3cf3d1aebe2f1c1bfd3/Screenshot%20from%202025-10-06%2019-04-59.png)
