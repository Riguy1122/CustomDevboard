## 10/6/2025 - Started a Kicad project!  

This is the beginning! I'm brand new to Kicad and even this type of project in general, so I've been playing around in the schematic view to get a feel for it. I've done research on the different tools and how to add components from the library to understand what I'm doing.![Screenshot from 2025-10-06 13-14-08.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6ODA2LCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--f693c70c080eadf7dccdd5718fc6fcfb0524a498/Screenshot%20from%202025-10-06%2013-14-08.png)
